## Hi there 👋

<div align="center">
  My name is Steven. I've been a nurse for over 10 years and am looking to get out of healthcare and into web development and game development. I've always had an interest in game development and have utilized Unity, and currently Godot, for small projects. I've dreamed of making an epic browser based strategy game, as I believe the web is where the future of gaming is.
  Currently I am trying to get better at the .NET environment as I really do love the C# language.
